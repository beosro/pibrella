### Help us to help you!

When reporting an issue it helps if you are as specific about your problem as possible.

Please include details such as:

* Your model of Raspberry Pi
* The OS you're using (`lsb_release -d` and `uname -a`)
* The steps you've taken so far
* Any solutions you've tried
* A paste of any error output from a script or library

We have a diagnostic script: `curl get.pimoroni.com/diagnostic | bash` to help you gather information.
